ATSW is a complete replacement for Blizzards tradeskill window with more overview and special functions. 

- a better overview 
The ATSW is bigger than the standard window, resulting in a much better overview over the thousands of items you can produce. Additionally, it lets you sort your recipes either by groups (as in the standard window), alphabetically or by difficulty. Alternatively, ATSW even lets you create your own groups and sort the recipes the way you like! 
ATSW also has a filter function: enter something into the filter line and ATSW hides all recipes that don't contain the text you entered. But this filter function can do more: it's a powerful search function that can filter for minimum/maximum level requirements, producable item counts, item rarity (color) and reagents necessary. Check out the readme for details on using this function! 

- more comfort 
The ATSW has a production queue: you can queue several different items and have them all produced automatically by just clicking one button. 
The ATSW is able to consider items you have to produce in order to use them as reagents in the production of other items. So: if you need item A to produce item B, you don't have to manually produce first item A, then item B. The ATSW does that for you: you just tell it to produce item B and it automatically queues the production of item A and - afterwards - item B. If you are missing some reagents to produce both items you get a message telling you exactly which reagents you need. 
ATSW helps you telling your friends what reagents you need for a specific item: just click on a recipe with your shift-key pressed and the chat line opened and the reagent info will be added to the chat line. 
ATSW shows you what reagents you need to process the whole production queue. It even tells you how many of each reagent you have in your bank, on alternative characters on the same server (in this case, it can even tell you on which characters) and which reagents are buyable from merchants. In case of buyable reagents ATSW can automatically buy all missing and available items from a merchant when you are speaking to him.
